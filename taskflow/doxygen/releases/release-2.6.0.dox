%Taskflow 2.6.0 is the 8th release in the 2.x line! 
This release includes several new changes such as CPU-GPU tasking, algorithm collection,
enhanced web-based profiler, documentation, and unit tests.

We have a new <a href="https://taskflow.github.io/">webpage</a> for %Taskflow!

@section release-2-6-0_new_features New Features

@li added explicit join behavior of tf::Subflow (see @ref JoinASubflow and @ref fibonacci)
@li added version macro (@c TF_VERSION, @c TF_MAJOR_VERSION, @c TF_MINOR_VERSION, @c TF_PATCH_VERSION) to retrieve version info programmatically (tf::version)
@li added @c TF_BUILD_TESTS and @c TF_BUILD_EXAMPLES (default on) to let users disable the build of tests and examples (see @ref install)
@li renamed tf::Taskflkow::parallel_for to tf::Taskflow::for_each to follow the STL convention
@li redesigned tf::Taskflow::for_each and tf::Taskflow::for_each_index using OpenMP-styled scheduling algorithms; this redesign largely improved the performance of parallel-for using a single dynamic task return, but it breaks the previous API that returned a std::pair of tasks to synchronize on a set of static parallel-for tasks. Yet, we believe adopting this change is not difficult (see @ref ParallelIterations).
@li added multiple unit tests for tf::Taskflow::for_each and tf::Taskflow::for_each_index at different partition algorithms; we have implemented our partition algorithms based on the OpenMP library implementation of LLVM and GCC.
@li added Mandelbrot application in the benchmark to evaluate the performance of parallel-for
@li redesigned tf::Taskflow::reduce and tf::Taskflow::transform_reduce based on the parallel architecture of tf::Taskflow::for_each (see @ref ParallelReduction).


@section release-2-6-0_bug_fixes Bug Fixes 

@li fixed the bug of iteratively detaching a subflow from a run loop or a condition loop
@li fixed the bug of conflict macro with boost (<a href="https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow/issues/184">#184</a>)

@section release-2-6-0_deprecated_items Deprecated Items 

@li removed two methods, tf::detached and tf::joined, due to the new join/detach behavior

@section release-2-6-0_miscellaneous_items Miscellaneous Items

@li improved the section @ref ObserveThreadActivities

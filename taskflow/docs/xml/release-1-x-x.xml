<para>Prior to being open-source in 2018, Cpp-Taskflow was internal to the <ulink url="https://github.com/OpenTimer/OpenTimer">OpenTimer</ulink> project sponsored by the NSF and DARPA. Later, we decided to open our knowledge of parallelizing large-scale parallel applications by making Cpp-Taskflow a standalone open-source project that can benefit generic C++ developers.</para>
<para>Due to the difference license agreement imposed by OpenTimer at an earlier stage (i.e., users and funding agency requirement), we are unable to open the source of Cpp-Taskflow in the 1.x line. Starting from 2.x, we have switched to MIT license and made the source completely open and transparent to the community. </para>
